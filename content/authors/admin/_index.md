I am a research specialist in the Emperical Studies of Conflict Project at Princeton University, where I study the role of violence in financial markets. My research is focused on how violence affects investor perceptions, and the role violence plays in the financial markets of fragile states. 

I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2020 with a BA in Government. I was born in Ghana, and I have a dog name Penelope. If you clicked her picture, I hope it brightened your day a bit!
